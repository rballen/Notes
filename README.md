Documents
=========

Repo for my documents, reference guides, notes, etc which I can easily update or refer to. I write nearly everything in markdown now and I use the following tools:

* [Strapdown.js](http://strapdownjs.com/) - Instant and elegant Markdown documents

* [Prose](http://prose.io/) - web-based interface for managing my documents

* [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io) - a cloud-enabled HTML5 Markdown editor.
